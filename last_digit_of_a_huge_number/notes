x1 ^ (x2 ^ (x3 ^ (... ^ xn)))



(x1 ^ (x2 ^ x3)) = x1 ^ (x2 ^ (x3/2) * x2 ^ (x3 - x3/2)) = (x1 ^ (x2 ^ (x3/2))) ^ (x2 ^ (x3 - x3/2))


(x1 ^ (x2 ^ x3)) = 10 * x + y

We only concern the value of y

Assume we have y for the following
x1 ^ (x2 ^ x3) = s * x + y

x1 = s * x + y
We may find a x2 such that
x1 ^ x2 = (s * x + y) ^ x2 = s * x' + y
